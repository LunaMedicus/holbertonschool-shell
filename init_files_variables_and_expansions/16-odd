#!/bin/bash
paste -d, - - | cut -d, -f1
# Usage: ./16-odd
# Output: (if input is a list of numbers, it will output the odd-indexed numbers)
# This script reads input from standard input and outputs the numbers located at odd indices (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.).
# It uses the paste command to combine pairs of lines with a comma as the delimiter, and then the cut command extracts the first field (the odd-indexed numbers).
# To use the script, you can pipe a list of numbers into it or redirect a file containing numbers.
# For example, if the input is:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# The output will be:
# 1
# 3
# 5
# The paste command with the -d, option combines every two lines of input into a single line, separated by a comma.
# The cut command with the -d, -f1 option extracts the first field from each combined line, effectively selecting the odd-indexed numbers from the original input   .
# This approach ensures that only the numbers at odd positions are printed in the output.
